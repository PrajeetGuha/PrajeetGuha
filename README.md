# 👋 Hey hey, cyber folks!

I'm **Prajeet Guha** — your friendly neighborhood **Blue Teamer** who loves rolling up sleeves, diving into logs, and keeping the bad guys on their toes! 😄🛡️

By day, I’m wrangling logs and chasing alerts. By night, I’m sneaking a peek at Red Team tricks to level up my defense game (because who says defenders can’t think like attackers too? 😏).

## 💻 What I Jam On (a.k.a. my Cybersecurity Playground)

- 📊 **SIEMs I vibe with**: ArcSight, Splunk, ELK — if it spits logs, I’m watching it!
- 🛡️ **EDR/XDR Guardians**: Crowdstrike, Cortex XDR, SentinelOne
- 🔎 **Threat Hunting & IR**: Alerts, incidents, chaos — I’m in!
- 👀 **Log Parsing & Monitoring**: Yes, I *actually* enjoy staring at logs (weird flex, but okay)
- 🧰 **Defender Magic**: MDO, MDI, MDE, plus all the good Microsoft stuff
- 🧬 **Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering**: Breaking down the baddies 🐛🔍
- ☁️ **Cloud Security Stuff**: AWS & Azure — keeping the skies clear
- 🧪 **Fun Tools**: Halcyon, Darktrace, Wireshark

## 🎒 Skills That Keep Me Grooving

- 💬 Talking tech with humans — I can explain logs *and* make it fun
- 👨‍💻 **Programming Side Quests**: Java, Python, PowerShell, C
- 📦 **Virtual Environments**: VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V (my lab is *chaos* in the best way)
- 🧾 **Case Management**: Jira, ServiceNow — where the ticket magic happens ✨

## 🏅 Certs & Learning Adventures

- ✅ **CompTIA Security+** — the entry badge to this wild ride
- 🧠 **Currently chasing CEH** — learning to sneak like an attacker (for good, of course!)
- 📚 Forever curious, forever learning — there’s always a new rabbit hole to dive into 🐇

## 🛡️ Global Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (GVIP)
I’m excited to be part of the ongoing discussions and planning for the **Global Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (GVIP)** under OWASP, where we’re working hard to find better ways to tackle CVE shortcomings.

Our goal? To create smarter, federated systems that improve how vulnerability info is shared across communities and tools — making the cybersecurity ecosystem faster, stronger, and more connected.

Being part of this effort means diving into threat modeling, collaborating with global experts, and helping build the future of vulnerability intelligence! 🌍🔐🚀
